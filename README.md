# CS2ServerBrowser
A server browser for CS2.  

Urgent:   
-further discussion on adding functionality is required  

Ideas/to-do list:  
-captcha for server adding  
-server managing tab  
-premium (paid) can change their banner etc  
-autochecks for things like 5v5 category cant have a server where the max is 64 players  
-report button for submitted servers incase of malicious or false server submissions  
-minigames r/place, skin float guessr, daily challenges can be added towards the end  
-start react and focusing on functionality once viko is home
 react tasks:
 - split what we already have in the preview into separate components
 - add functionality to components
   - fetch server info such as players, current map, player ping etc.
   - display info for map by showing images
   - make this process repeat at an interval of seconds (update every 5-30 seconds)
 - call them in the pages where they will be used
 - optimize for speed and efficiency
-create more splashes for the info boxes that fit the themes e.g. a surf themed splash   

Things to research and challenges:  
-how to live update server player count  
-how to live update ping relative to each server  
-maybe how to include player profile preview of those that are connected to the server including faceit rank (common)  
-submission handling, report system and queue  
-set up a button to make cs2 client autojoin the match as opposed to copy pasting the ip every time
