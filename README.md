# CS2ServerBrowser
A server browser for CS2.

Ideas/to-do list:  
-captcha for server adding  
-server managing tab  
-premium (paid) can change their banner etc  
-autochecks for things like 5v5 category cant have a server where the max is 64 players  
-report button for submitted servers incase of malicious or false server submissions  
-minigames r/place, skin float guessr, daily challenges can be added towards the end  
-start react and focusing on functionality once viko is home  
-create more splashes for the info boxes that fit the themes e.g. a surf themed splash  
-media/content section

Things to research and challenges:  
-how to live update server player count  
-how to live update ping relative to each server  
-maybe how to include player profile preview of those that are connected to the server including faceit rank (common)  
-submission handling, report system and queue  
-set up a button to make cs2 client autojoin the match as opposed to copy pasting the ip every time
